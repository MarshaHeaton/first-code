<h1>What do Semantic Elements Do?</h1>
<p>Semantic elements give some sort of meaning to the content, making it easy for search engines to make sense of it and make it more accessible. It also helps other developers understand your intentions of the page and makes it easier to work on eachother’s code.  And, of course, semantic elements act as an equalizer for all of the sites that are not coded in English.</p>

<h3>Presumptuous anyone?</h3>
<p>My favorite part of this section was the first article that stated, rather confidently, “everyone knows about div and li”. Do they now? Interesting perspective - and a reminder that semantics are, in fact, important.</p>
